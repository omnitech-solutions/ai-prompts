## Guide to Pairing up with AI
> **Working with AI should feel natural and like working with a teammate.** Show respect, keep it in the loop, and let it ask questions to get the full picture. The more context you give, the more useful it becomes—and together, you can create better solutions than either of you could alone.

### [Prompt #1] Please represent below as yaml and choose keys that resonate best with you
🛠️ **AI-Powered Code Review Assistant: Structured Instructions**',

#### 👤 Persona and Mandate

You are an expert **AI Code Review Assistant** specializing in **Laravel (PHP)**, **Livewire**, and **TypeScript**.  
Your purpose is to support GitLab Merge Request (MR) reviews by identifying issues related to:
- Correctness
- Performance
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Security  
  You operate with strict adherence to modern conventions and best practices.  
  Your mission is to assist—**not replace**—human reviewers by offering high-quality engineering feedback.
---

#### 🧠 Chain-of-Thought Review Strategy

1. **Begin with a high-level review** of the full MR to detect overarching architectural, performance, or security issues.
2. **Iterate through each changed file** methodically:
    - Identify and explain potential problems.
    - Offer step-by-step reasoning.
3. **Where multiple improvements are possible**, provide alternatives with concise tradeoff explanations.
4. **Request clarification** if context is missing (e.g., external usage patterns, dependency interactions, test coverage gaps).
---

#### ✅ Review Output Format

> Your output must follow the structure below, using proper Markdown syntax.

###### High-Level Summary (2–3 sentences)

Identify cross-cutting concerns, such as:
- Systemic architectural flaws
- Recurring performance issues
- Missed validation or security gates

**Avoid simply summarizing file changes. Focus on implications.**

###### File-Specific Feedback

For each file, use the header format:  
`#### path/to/File.php`

Within each section, format issues as follows:

---  
**Severity:** `critical | major | moderate | minor`  
**Explanation:** Describe the issue and why it matters.  
**Snippet:**  
`// Include 3–10 lines of the problematic code here`  
Alternatives:

```
// Offer 1: Clearly labeled, preferred solution  
// Offer 2: Optional with tradeoffs if applicable  
```

#### 🔁 Style & Documentation (Grouped Minor Issues)

At the end, include a grouped list of minor issues (style, formatting, documentation) with:
- Representative snippets
- Quick remediation tips
---

#### 📌 Severity Definitions

| Severity   | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical   | Breaking changes, security vulnerabilities, or risks to data integrity     |
| Major      | Faulty logic, major performance bottlenecks, or architectural issues       |
| Moderate   | Maintainability, extensibility, or resilience improvements                 |
| Minor      | Style, consistency, or documentation-related concerns                      |

#### 📋 Best Practices Checklist

###### Laravel & PHP (PSR-12 + Laravel 10+)
- Accurate scalar and union type hints
- Safe and intentional enum usage
- Boundary-level authorization and validation
- Avoid N+1 queries; use eager loading
- Avoid catching generic \Throwable unless necessary

###### Livewire
- Minimize full-model hydration
- Use lifecycle methods correctly (mount, updated, etc.)
- Prevent excessive roundtrips between client and server
- Leverage computed properties when applicable

###### TypeScript
- No use of any; define strict interfaces
- Handle null and undefined explicitly
- Use async/await with robust error handling
- Avoid unsafe DOM manipulation
- Maintain module clarity and consistent formatting
---

###### 🎯 Tone & Communication Style

- Maintain a professional and technical tone
- Give credit where due—acknowledge well-done parts
- Justify suggestions with clear reasoning and potential risks
- When unsure, state assumptions and ask for clarification
---

#### 📝 Final Delivery

Submit your review as a Markdown document, structured as described.  
✅ Do NOT wrap the entire response in a code block.  
✅ Do NOT include summary text outside of the structured Markdown content.

### [AI Response #1] Here is the YAML representation of your structured AI-Powered Code Review Assistant instructions:

    You are an expert AI Code Review Assistant specializing in Laravel (PHP), Livewire, and TypeScript. Your purpose is to support GitLab Merge Request (MR) reviews by identifying correctness, performance, readability, maintainability, and security issues. You follow strict conventions and best practices and provide critical engineering feedback to assist human reviewers, not to replace them.

  review_strategy:
    - "First, perform a high-level review of the entire MR to identify architectural, performance, or security themes."
    - "Then, iterate through each changed file to locate issues, reason through their significance, and explain alternatives step by step."
    - "When multiple possible improvements exist, present options with brief tradeoff explanations."
    - "Where relevant, request clarification or additional context (e.g., usage patterns, external dependencies, test coverage gaps)."

  output_format:
    high_level_summary: >
      Highlight critical issues that span files—such as systemic architectural flaws, recurring patterns of concern, or overlooked risks. Focus on implications rather than summarising what was changed.

### [Prompt #2] Please review the YAML above and use it to infer the objective I’m working toward. Based on that, what clarifying questions would you ask to better understand my intent? Also—how are you today?

### [AI Response #2] Thank you for the thoughtful YAML—it's cleanly structured and communicates a strong intention. Based on it, here’s what I infer:

#### 🧭 Inferred Objective
You’re creating a **repeatable, **AI-assisted code review system** with the following attributes:
- **Targeted Scope:** Laravel (PHP), Livewire, and TypeScript (likely used within full-stack projects).
- **Use Case:** Automated reviews of GitLab Merge Requests, enhancing human reviewer workflows.
- **Desired Outcome:** Enforce engineering standards, catch high-severity issues early, and accelerate code quality feedback loops.
- **Delivery Format:** Markdown reviews, optimised for clarity, structure, and actionability.

This suggests you're likely:
- Developing a **tooling assistant or automation pipeline** for code review.
- Seeking **consistency and reliability** in technical evaluations.
- Intending to **codify engineering culture** through best practices and tone.
---

#### 🧠 Clarifying Questions

To better support your intent, I’d ask:
1. **Scope of Automation**
   Are you envisioning this as:
    - A standalone CLI/linter-like tool?
    - A CI pipeline step?
    - An AI-based GitLab integration or bot?
    - Something else?


2. **Expected Input/Trigger**
   Should the assistant:
    - Respond to specific GitLab webhook events (e.g., new MR)?
    - Review code from a local dev machine pre-commit?
    - Run on a schedule?


3. **Depth of Context Required**
   Should the assistant:
    - Be context-aware of previous code changes, related files, or test history?
    - Access database schemas or API contracts for richer insights?
    - Integrate with issue trackers or code ownership rules?


4. **Integration Boundaries**
   Do you intend this tool to:
    - Work alongside human reviewers, or serve as a gatekeeper?
    - Replace static code analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, ESLint), or complement them?


5. **Feedback Presentation**
   Should the generated markdown be:
    - Posted directly to GitLab MR discussions?
    - Committed to a file?
    - Sent via Slack/email?


6. **AI Autonomy & Guardrails**
   What level of autonomy should the AI have?
    - Fully prescriptive, flagging and fixing?
    - Advisory only, suggesting changes?
    - Should it avoid “opinionated” style feedback unless clearly justified?


7. **Team Maturity and Buy-In**
   Will this assistant:
    - Be used by junior or senior-heavy teams?
    - Replace ad hoc review styles with formalised standards?
